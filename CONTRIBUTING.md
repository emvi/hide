# Contribute

Report bugs on GitHub and discuss your ideas and feature requests before you open a pull request. Pull requests must pass the test suite and add new tests for each new feature. Bugs should be validated by tests. The Go code must be formatted by gofmt.

## Execute tests

To execute the tests, you need to have all supported databases installed (for integration tests). The tests can then be executed by running the *run_tests* script or by executing the steps inside manually. All tests must be passed before a pull request can be opened. New code must be tested to keep the test coverage above 80% at least.
